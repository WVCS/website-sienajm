        <p>my interests</p>
<p2> I love going to the beach or any outing with my friends. I can make any errand task or activity fun when I'm with my friends. In my own time, I love to always have music playing in the background of whatever I'm doing. I also tend to bake or cook whenever I have the time or ingredients. I also love spending time with my pets and watching movies or binging shows with my family.

<p>my academic pursuits</p>
<p2>I am currently deciding between Syracuse and CSU Long Beach for my next 4 in undergrad. For either school, I will be majoring in communications. I am excited to also get a change of scenery from San Diego (even if I am as close as Long Beach). I am considering continuing into an MBA afterwards as well.

 <br>
<p>my favorite experiences</p>
<p2>My family has always made an effort to take my brother and me travelling. I've now visited 7 countries outside of the U.S. and I've loved every single trip. It's always a blast and I love exploring the different cultures that the world has to offer. It's something that I felt has always lead me towards wanting to study in communications.
